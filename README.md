# Major-Project

The basis of this project was to create a web (third-party) application where the main focus is to gather a user’s activity data from activity trackers where different types of activity trackers are able to communicate and compare data with each other. Activity trackers are starting to become a popular trend as they are easy to use and highly portable where by just holding a device it can help one improve on reaching certain health and fitness goals. One of the two biggest corporations for tracking a person’s activity is Fitbit and Apple. As the data between these two corporations cannot be cooperated, this purpose of this web application is to be able to communicate data from the two different systems. The web application includes a friend system to compare your steps per day with a friend. OAuth 2.0 is used to gather user’s data from the Fitbit API and Apple Health Kit is used to gather user’s data from Apple.
